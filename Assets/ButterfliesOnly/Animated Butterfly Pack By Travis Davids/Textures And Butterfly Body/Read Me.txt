All required files to follow along with the tutorial are included in this folder. 

Only open the Blender 2.80 folder if you plan on using a .PNG image in blender to setup the diffuse and opacity. 

For the tutorial you just need the main DIFFUSE, ALPHA OR OPACITY MASK AND THE NORMAL MAP.

The Basic Butterfly Body is included as well and is provided in .OBJ format. 

There's also a very basic textured map for the butterflies body if you want to use it. 

I've included the original Morpho Didius image as well in case you wanted to see it. 

ENJOY!
